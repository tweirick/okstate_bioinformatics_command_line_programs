This folder contains a collection of command line programs for calculating 
various statistics and manipulating tab delimited columns in tsv files. 
They were originally created for processing and calculating significance of 
protein expression data generated through mass spectrometry. However, they 
were written generally so they could be applicable to other scenarios in 
which large amounts of statistics need to be calculated. 

To run these you will need python 2.7+ or python 3.2+, the rpy2 library, 
and the qvalue library from bioconductor (for Storey FDR only).
